    "# Assignment 1\n",
    "Entropy can be used as a feature in most of our machine learning applications. For this assignment try to extract the entropy of an image to classify damage vs undamaged satellite images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "1. **Preprocess the images**: Convert each RGB satellite image to grayscale.\n",
    "2. **Apply the Shannon entropy formula** to compute the entropy of:\n",
    "   - The whole image **or**\n",
    "   - Multiple sliding windows across the image (for localized entropy estimation).\n",
    "3. **Experiment with different parameters**:\n",
    "   - Vary the **window size** (e.g., 8x8, 16x16, etc.)\n",
    "   - Try **thresholding** the grayscale values or binning intensity levels\n",
    "4. **Extract entropy-based features** (e.g., mean, variance, max entropy across windows).\n",
    "5. **Train a classifier** (e.g., logistic regression, SVM, random forest) to predict if the image is **damaged** or **undamaged** based solely on entropy-derived features.\n",
    "6. **Evaluate the model** using accuracy, precision, recall, and/or confusion matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: You have two controllable dimensions in your feature extraction pipeline:\n",
    "- Window size - affects the granularity of entropy localization\n",
    "- Grayscale binning or thresholds - affects how patterns and noise are detected\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which entropy features (e.g., mean entropy, max entropy) were most useful for classification?\n",
    "2. How does changing the window size affect your classifierâ€™s performance?\n",
    "3. Did thresholding or binning the grayscale values help or hurt entropy-based differentiation?\n",
    "4. Is there a noticeable difference in entropy distribution between damaged and undamaged images?\n",
    "6. How do you think can entropy-based classification compare to using raw pixel values or CNNs?"
