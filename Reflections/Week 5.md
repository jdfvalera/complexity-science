### Week 5 Reflection: Cellular Automata and Agent-Based Models (continued)

## Intro

Week 5 was all about the CA and ABM notebook which was very visual and very interesting for me, because when as a coffee addict, when somebody says percolation, I hear coffee grinder! 

## Takeaways

One of the big ideas this week was how percolation models can show when a system suddenly shifts from small, disconnected clusters to one giant connected network. What really stuck with me is how this happens at a critical threshold. Just a slight increase in the connection probability, and ta-daaa you’ve got a whole network linked up. The lecture made connections to things like how diseases spread, how wildfires jump between trees, and how networks break down or hold together. It made me see how much real-world complexity comes out of simple probabilities.

## Highlight

The part that clicked for me was seeing that “snap” moment when the system crosses the threshold. One second everything looks random and scattered, and the next, a giant cluster forms and spans the whole grid. The visuals made it so clear. It made me think about how fragile or robust systems are in real life—like how fast something can go from stable to chaotic with just a small nudge.
