### Week 10 Reflection: Final Project Presentations

I was happy to see everyone's final projects! Love how there are so many ways complexity science could be applied to real world problems, whether big or small.

I was especially thrilled by Professor Gino’s take on our project. I loved how they looked at our presentation and saw how our model, which had a bit of a kinky edge, could be applied in a totally new way to influence people’s decisions by swaying them toward one choice or another. Their insight showed how our work could ripple out to shape behaviors in unexpected contexts, which really drove home the versatility of complexity science.

Going rogue with this reflection feels right because complexity science itself defies rigid structure. This course taught me to embrace uncertainty, to see systems as constantly moving things rather than static puzzles. I’m walking a new skill. One that thrives on spotting connections and finding beauty in the unpredictable.
