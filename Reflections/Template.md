### Notes
- **Flexibility**: The "Highlight" placeholder is your weekly variableâ€”swap in what excites you each time.
- **Tone**: Keep it casual and reflective, like a blog, per the course requirement.
- **Length**: Aim for brevity (e.g., 250-400 words), unless otherwise specified.

## Disclaimer
- Outline created via Grok with the prompts:
   - "I need to make a reflection for my complexity science class. Please give me an outline, one that will highlight something that I really liked during the lecture, so leave a place holder for that."
   - "Since I will be doing this every week, I want a constant tempalte."
   - "maybe, intro, takeaways, highlight, other thoughts, conclusion"
