### Week 1 Reflection: Introduction to Complexity Science

#### Intro

For the first session of this class, I walked in with no thoughts and just vibes. I literally had no expectations and did not know what to expect. In my mind, I was taking this class because this is what we pitched for our Capstone project. Little did I know, I would grow to be completely interested in this field after just one session.

#### Takeaways

It wasn't my first time hearing about complex systems, since my team and I did a quick crash course for the Capstone proposal. However, I got a better understanding of what complex systems are as discussed in class. The key concept for me in this session is **RELATIONSHIPS** among parts of a system or between a system and its environment. Relationships in society and in nature are so complicated, yet so beautiful. It goes to show that the world is not just black or white or a one-way street, but really a whole interconnected system.

The use cases presented were also interesting given my fascination with, not necessarily transportation but road safety. I would like to dive deeper into how complex systems can be used in providing safer roads for drivers, commuters, and pedestrians.

#### Highlight

The other key concept that really got me hooked was the concept of **self-organization and emergence**. The activity about trying to model the virality of a meme as a system really stood out since it gave more context to how simple rules that are followed by individuals create a bigger group behavior. It was a good exercise because how something goes viral is something I have been asked multiple times in my previous jobs as a media analyst and as a marketer. It was the first time that I have come to realize that making something viral requires the most basic understanding of the rules that everyone follows, and not just a select few. It's one thing to target the audience, but it is another to understand that each one will inherently follow a rule that creates an overall emergent behavior.

#### Other Thoughts

While on the topic of rules, it also came to mind about something I was interested in back in undergrad, which was social deviance. Particularly, I was thinking about informal deviance of subcultures in the kink community where deviant behavior thrives and creates its own patterns. If you come to think of it, the kink community can be modeled where participating individuals follow a certain set of rules on consent, safety, and roles. From that, a certain subculture arises which can also evolve based on the environment -- the definition of a complex system, based on my understanding. I won't go into more detail for now, to keep it safe for work.

#### Conclusion

This first lecture flipped my "no thoughts, just vibes" mindset into a full-on interest in complexity science. The interplay of relationships and the subsequent (or concurrent?) self-organization opened my eyes to a world that looks messy but still ordered in its own way. That's actually my cup of tea! Excited to see if I can actually flesh out either that road safety or niche communities topic into an actual project using complex systems!
