### Week 8 Reflection: Networks

## Intro

This session on network science felt like unlocking a secret level in a game. After last week’s game theory fun (even if I was late), I was ready to dive into graphs, nodes, and edges. The lecture was dense but clicked perfectly with my final project on the kink community, cementing it as my focus. Networks were the missing piece I needed to model those social dynamics.

## Takeaways

Network science is all about connections. Nodes (people, places, things) and edges (relationships, interactions). We started with graph theory basics, like the Bridges of Königsberg problem, showing how math models pairwise relations. Key concepts included directionality, adjacency, and the like felt a bit too boring at first but I was into it. Of course, what is the world without metrics, so degrees, clustering coefficients, and centrality had to be mentioned. The lecture highlighted network types: random (Erdős-Rényi), small-world (Watts-Strogatz, high clustering, short paths), and scale-free (Barabási-Albert, with hubs following a power-law). Real-world examples—social media, roads, neural networks—showed networks everywhere. The hands-on activity that made us draw our personal networks, made me realize, I have way too many people in my life to mention. Hahaha

## Highlight

The activity where we drew our personal networks was fun at first then it got daunting. I had to continue it at home! I mapped out people I interact with monthly and connecting them if they knew each other. My network had clear clusters. Work friends, gaming buddies, family, and my partner's connections. I was surprised to see myself as a central node bridging groups, but that's because I was making that network. Comparing it to my Instagram network, I noticed online connections were looser, with more one-off ties. This exercise screamed relevance for my kink community project. I could see practitioners as nodes, with edges for scenes, trust, or mentorship. Then it would form clusters around events or roles. Scale-free networks, with hubs like expert practitioners, felt like the perfect fit to model influence and skill diffusion.

## Other Thoughts

This week sealed the deal for my final project. The kink community idea. I just have to figure our if I'm modeling trust, roles, or skill sharing. But it all lined up so well with network science. I’m picturing a scale-free network where a few high-reputation practitioners (hubs) drive learning and scene dynamics, with clustering around rope jams or workshops. The only downside? I feel like I have to self study a lot.

## Conclusion
Week 8 was a great! Tying network science to my kink community project felt like the perfect knot. The personal network activity and scale-free insights were gold, and I’m stoked to build a model with hubs and clusters.
