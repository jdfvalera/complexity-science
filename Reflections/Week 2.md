### Week 2 Reflection: Chaos Theory and Dynamical Systems

#### Intro

Okay, a 9am class is not my favorite thing, but I was excited to go to this 9am class because it was COmplexity Science Week 2! After last week’s peek relationships and emergence, I was hyped to see what new mind-blowing things will this session drop. Spoiler: chaos theory and dynamical systems delivered! It’s like the sci-fi plot of my nerd dreams crashed into a lecture hall, and I was living for it.

Also, we did a quick review where we shared what parts of complexity science we’re vibing with, and I got to drop a little about my interest in the BDSM kink community. Kept it chill, just tying it to how rules like consent and safety spark emergent subcultures, like we talked about last week with self-organization. It was nice to see my niche curiosity fit right into this big, chaotic puzzle. He (the prof) also said it - the thing he said last time when I sat in at his Geospatial Analysis class presentations! #NoToKinkShaming Hahaha.

#### Takeaways

This week was a ride through chaos theory and dynamical systems, and I’m starting to feel like I’m decoding the universe’s hidden rules. *in Maja Salvador voice: (UNIVERSE'S HIDDEN RULES?!?!)* Dynamical systems are all about things that evolve over time based on some logic, like stock prices ticking along or a pendulum swinging. I got how they have a “state” (where they’re at), a “rule” (how they shift), and “time” (step-by-step or continuous). It’s like the traffic, weather, and even memes are dancing to some invisible beat, even when it looks totally unhinged.

The butterfly effect was the real star for me. I’ve been intrigued with it ever since I binged *Steins;Gate*, that sci-fi anime where one tiny text sent to the past flips the whole world upside down. Learning that this isn’t just a cool time-travel trope but an actual thing in chaotic systems, where a small tweak in initial conditions can snowball into massive change, was like my nerdy heart doing a backflip. It’s chaos, but it’s *ordered* chaos. I LOVE IT.

#### Highlight

A highlight for me was coding a dynamical system in class. We started with a predictable system logistic map, then nudged it until it went full chaotic. I was like, #StoryOfMyLife. One minute you're stable, then enxt minute, it's total chaos. It hit me that nothing stays steady forever, and that’s not a bug, it’s a feature. And we gotta live with that. Coding that shift made chaos feel tangible, and now I’m interested to know what other simulations can I play around with.

#### Other Thoughts

One idea that stuck with me was a flashback to my undergrad stats classes, where people argued nothing’s *really* random. Chaos theory brought that back hard. Prof. Gino said some systems *look* random (like a coin toss or even sweepstakes), but if you knew every single detail, they’d be deterministic. It’s like those trippy fractal strange attractors we saw: chaotic but still bound by some cosmic rulebook.

I’m starting to see chaos theory everywhere, especially my interest in road safety. The butterfly effect screams highways—one driver’s split-second swerve could jam up a whole city. I’m wondering if I could model traffic as a dynamical system, maybe find attractors for safer flow? Oh, and that kink community angle, those rules and roles feel like a system that could tip into new subcultures with just a small nudge. Really interested in these two things so far. I would like to explore more what other topics can I do for a project.

#### Conclusion

Week 2 turned my “I’m hooked” energy from last week into a full-on "I wanna know more!" Chaos theory feels like *Steins;Gate* meets my need to make sense of life’s messiness, or maybe I'm just trying to justify why my messy room works for me! From coding systems that flip to chaos, to tying *wink* my kink community interest to complexity, to dreaming up traffic safety, I’m seeing the world as one big dynamical system, and I want in. I’m happy to mess with more simulations and maybe pitch a project blending the butterfly effect with something real, like safer roads or evolving subcultures. Still Excited for the next week!
