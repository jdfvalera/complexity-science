### Week 9 Reflection: Graph Neural Networks

## Intro

After vibing with network science last week, I thought I was ready, but GNNs had me lost AF, hahaha. The lecture was intense, and my brain was scrambling. I was swamped with end-of-term projects and totally zoned out. I know I should’ve listened better, but between deadlines and my kink community project, GNNs just didn’t stick.

## Takeaway and Highlight

My only takeaway and highlight from this session was that visualization on social influence. The visualization showed a GNN modeling influence propagation across a network of nodes (people) and edges (relationships). Nodes updated their behavior based on their neighbors’ status, with influence strength tied to factors like distance (steps between nodes) and degree (number of connections). Key insights included how influence spreads unevenly. Nodes close to high-status “influencers” changed quickly, while peripheral nodes lagged.

## Thoughts and Conclusions

At this point, my brain was already half-fried from all other requirements, and I feel like this session was the least I could remember. It was the last lecture and I wish I had the mental capacity to understand it better. I'll try to find time during the break to do some self studying on this.
