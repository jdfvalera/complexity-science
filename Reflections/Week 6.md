### Week 6 Reflection: Evolution and Learning

## Intro

Week 6 of our Complexity Science course tackled evolution and learning. Honestly, I went into this lecture feeling a bit disconnected, not knowing the topic beforehand and struggling to stay engaged. Evolution and computational models sounded intriguing, but my mind was elsewhere, making this the session I zoned out on the most.

## Takeaways

Systems go from basic to complex via natural selection. It’s not about creatures “choosing” to adapt but random mutations creating diversity, with some environmental factors to pick "winners". Genetic algorithms were a big focus: initializing a population, evaluating fitness, and mixing traits through crossovers and mutation. (I was mainly lost at this point tbh). We also got a crash course on metaheuristic algorithms like Spider Monkey and Cuckoo Optimization, which draw from nature to solve real-world problems like diagnosing diseases. The healthcare angle was cool but it felt like a lot to process when I was barely hanging on.

## Highlight

Even in my my lost state, Spider Monkey Optimization stood out. It’s based on how spider monkeys split and regroup while foraging. It was giving divide and conquer, then regroup. It balances self-organization and division of labor to tackle complex problems. The lecture mentioned it predicting COVID-19 outcomes great accuracy, which is wild for a nature-inspired algorithm. It clicked (kinda) because it reminded me of my of two weeks ago with simple rules, big results. I could see coding something like this for a strategy game AI, but my head wasn’t fully in it.

## Other Thoughts

The genetic algorithm’s iterative vibe is like tweaking game mechanics, but the math-heavy metaheuristics felt like a boss fight I wasn’t leveled up for. I’m still into my road safety idea, maybe a genetic algorithm could evolve traffic rules to minimize crashes on a hex grid. For the kink community project, I could see metaheuristics optimizing social dynamics, like finding ideal event structures, but I’d need to actually understand this stuff first. Haha


## Conclusion
Week 6 was a slog, and I was mentally AFK for most of it. The nature-inspired algorithms were neat, especially Spider Monkey, but I’m kicking myself for not staying focused.
