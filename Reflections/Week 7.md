### Week 7 Reflection: Game Week

## Intro

Week 7 was a chaotic one for me. I rolled into the Aboitiz Tech Space late, missing the first half of class thanks to a brutal morning commute. After last week’s brain fog, I was hyped to hear we were playing games to explore self-organization, cooperation, and competition, but I only caught the tail end. Still, the vibe was so fuuun, and I jumped right into it.

## Takeaways

Since I missed the opening, I pieced together the self-organization stuff from notes and classmates. It’s about systems creating complex patterns without a central plan like bird flocks or social networks. Local interactions lead to global order, which is wild. The lecture touched on models like Schelling’s Segregation Model, where mild preferences cause neighborhood segregation (like it was the 1950s again!). The real action, though, was game theory. Most of the games were played while I was inside the Grab, so I only get to look at my classmates through the screen. They played the Prisoner's Dilemma, where players choose to cooperate or defect, and learned about Nash equilibrium, where no one can improve their payoff by switching strategies alone. They also played Public Goods Game, Stag Hunt, and my favorite, Colonel Blotto. These games showed how strategic choices shape outcomes, from trust to competition.

## Highlight

Colonel Blotto was pure chaos and I loved it! We split into Team A and Team B, each with 20 soldiers to spread across five battlefronts. More soldiers on a front wins it, and most fronts wins the game. I jumped into Team B, helping decide our soldier split. We tried a sneaky balanced spread but got wrecked when Team A stacked one front. The modified version with espionage (peeking at one front) and sequential moves felt like a strategy game straight out of my Steam library. It’s like allocating resources in real life—think ad budgets or traffic controls. I’m itching to code a Blotto AI to mess with different strategies. And thank god for that assignment that threw me into a rabbbit hole. I could ahve gone all the way with all the strategies and all the simulations.

## Other Thoughts

Showing up late meant I missed the self-organization deep dive, which sucked because it sounds like my jam! Emergent patterns are gamer catnip. Game theory, though, was a blast and made up for it. At this point, I kinda wanna focus on the kink. Stag Hunt kinda fits. Do people risk big scenes (stag) or play it safe (rabbit)? The Public Goods Game also vibes with shared community resources, like event spaces. I used AI to fill in the gaps from the first half, but I gotta stop cutting it close with time. Being late made me feel like I was playing catch-up all session.


## Conclusion
Week 7 was a wild ride, even if I only caught half. Colonel Blotto stole the show, and game theory got my strategy nerd heart pumping. I’m bummed about missing the self-organization stuff, but I’m fired up for Week 8. Hopefully, we’ll get that Jupyter notebook to play with, and I’ll actually show up on time!
